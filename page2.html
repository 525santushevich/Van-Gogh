            <h2 class="card_title">Childhood</h2>
            <p class="card_text">Vincent van Gogh was born in the Brabant village of Zundert on 30 March 1853. The Van
              Gogh family went on frequent walks in the area around Zundert, helping to instil a great love of nature in
              the future artist. At the age of eleven, Vincent transferred to a boarding school in Zevenbergen where he
              was deeply unhappy, but managed to complete his elementary schooling. Vincent didn't find his direction in
              life until he was 27 years old.</p>

            <h2 class="card_title">Successful Years</h2>
            <p class="card_text">Vincent's parents weren't very happy with his dream of an artist's life. Fortunately,
              that did not stop Vincent from working hard and improving his skills. He practiced drawing and frequently
              worked out of doors, while his brother supported him financially Vincent took painting lessons in The
              Hague from a cousin by marriage, the celebrated artist Anton Mauve.Mauve taught Vincent the basics of
              painting in watercolour and oils and Van Gogh visited his studio almost every day. Vincent van Gogh spent
              one year in the mental hospital in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Despite his unstable mental health, he was very
              productive: he made about 150 paintings in a year.</p>

            <h2 class="card_title">Later In Life</h2>
            <p class="card_text">Vincent spent the final months of his life in an artists' village near Paris. The
              village offered Vincent the peace and quiet he needed, while being close enough to Paris for him to visit
              his brother Theo. Vincent was advised to devote himself completely to his art. He did precisely that,
              painting the gardens and wheatfields around the village at a feverish rate. No matter how 'healthy and
              fortifying' Vincent found the countryside, it was to no avail. His illness and his uncertainty about the
              future became too much. On 27 July 1890, he walked into a wheatfield and shot himself in the chest with a
              pistol. Vincent was buried at Auvers on 30 July 1890. His legacy was a large body of art works: over 850
              paintings and almost 1,300 works on paper.</p>

            attendance at exhibitions of his works reveal that, within the span of a century, van Gogh has become
            perhaps the most recognized painter of all time. The prices his works have attained through auction and the
            attention paid to forgery scandals have only increased van Gogh’s stature in the public imagination.</h5>

            reflecting his ongoing pursuit of complementary colors and a bolder form. His collection of self-portraits
            places him among the most dynamic self-portraitists of all time. Nowadays, people attempt to use his
            approach to art and create new perspectives for the future society.</h5>

          <h5 class="card-title">Vincent Van Gogh was born into a family of a low social class. He had always enjoyed art even though his parents didn't agree with his perspective. However, his parents as well as his siblings supported Vincent on his path to success. Additionally, Vincent's brother, Theo, had art of his own but not up to the standards of Vincent.</h5>

Earlier, Van Gogh had moved to Arles from Paris in order to establish what he called a “studio of the south”.

          <h5 class="card-title">Vincent van Gogh is mostly remembered for his striking color, definitive brushwork, and contoured forms of his art. While his paintings were beautiful works of art, they weren't appreciated while he was alive, primarily because he was smarter and ahead of his time, unsociable, mentally troubled, and uninterested in marketing himself.</h5>

          <h5 class="card-title">Vincent van Gogh struggled with mental illness throughout his life, but put his struggles into his art to eventually become one of the greatest artists in history. Depression and confusion caused Vincent Van Gogh to cut off his ear, shocking most of his companions. Sadly, on July 29 of 1890, Vincent Van Gogh committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest.</h5>
